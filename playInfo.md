## Play info

Growth mindset is an idle game for those with an eye on a growth mindset. The objective is to gain as many neurons as possible to purchase upgrades that speed up the rate of your neuron growth.

Each upgrade in your mindset requires a minimum number of neurons to 'learn' it. Then your upgrade will increase your neuron gains per second. You can grow from a simple student, speeding up your brain growth to supernatural god-like powers!

Gameplay will save every one second and will be safely stored for your next play when you close the browser.

**Important information** Your state data, including neuron total, neurons/sec and upgrades is saved in Local storage. If you would like to reset this data, click the Reset button. Alternatively: Open your developer tools | Navigate to the Application tab | Select the Local storage option | Delete the 'state' object.
